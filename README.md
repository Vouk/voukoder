# VOUKODER
Use x264, x265 and other encoders of the libav or ffmpeg library directly in Adobe Premiere (Pro and Elements). Currently supporting:
- x264 (8 bit only)
- x265 (8, 10 and 12bit)
- ProRes (experimental)
- FFV1 (experimental)

See the **Wiki** page for more details.

This plugin is under heavy development and not yet ready for production use - ... although the results are pretty much useable already.
Currently this plugin is for **Windows only**. I do not have a Mac computer available to develop a Mac version.

## How to get it
You can find the latest version on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder/releases).

Please read the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder/wiki/Installation) carefully.

## Donations

### Paypal
Although you can use this plugin for free i do appreciate getting donations. Working on the plugin consumes alot of time after my regular work. Press the button below to donate.

### Non-monetary support
I really need good **hardware with high performance** on compiling and rendering videos. This would speed up development alot. I currently compile, develop and test on a Intel NUC Core i3. I could also use some video equipment like an **Elgato Cam Link** and a **DSLM (GH4/5 or similar)**. 

Some people asked me to develop a Mac version of this plugin. That requires a **decent iMac, MacMini or MacPro** to do so.

If you want to support me with this please get in direct contact with me (see below).
