# VOUKODER
Use x264, x265 and other encoders of the libav or ffmpeg library directly in Adobe Premiere (Pro and Elements). Currently supporting:
- x264 (8 bit only)
- x265 (8, 10 and 12bit)
- NVENC (h.264 and h.265)
- ProRes (experimental)

The **8-bit modes are pretty stable and optimzed** right now. The high bit depth modes are experimental and not optimized yet.
This plugin is written for **Windows 10**. It might work with other Windows version but i can't test it. MacOS is not supported.

## Download & Installation
You can find the latest version on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder/releases). Please read the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder/wiki/Installation) carefully.

## Update the plugin
Simply replace the plugin with the new version.

**Note**: It might happen some strange settings appear / disappear. Simply select a different exporter (i.e. AVI) and then select "Voukoder" again. This will reset the settings. Deleting your presets might also help.

## Donations
### Paypal
Although you can use this plugin for free i do appreciate getting donations. Working on the plugin consumes alot of time after my regular work. Press the button below to donate.

### Non-monetary support
I really need good **hardware with high performance** on compiling and rendering videos. This would speed up development alot. I currently compile, develop and test on a Intel NUC Core i3 and an i7 4770. 

If you want to support me with this please get in direct contact with me (see below).
